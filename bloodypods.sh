# Executes by Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, & Cellular. Satellite and other radios are untested as of 09/17/2025.
# Loading payload while audio playing requires a pause press then a play press again to execute payload (2x button press).
# Loading payload while audio paused requires a play/pause/play press to execute payload (3x button press).
# To run the same payload two or more times consecutively track press away from payload and back to payload must be performed to execute same payload again.
# Loading Payloads can also be done by entering 'Payload##' with specific number and Payload in the name field area of a device in the iCloud such as an iPhone, iPad, or AirPod.
# Payloads can also be executed by entering 'AVRCP Play' in name field area of iOS device (iPhone, iPad) connected to iCloud of macOS host/target device or send bluetooth connection attempt to host/targe$
# First name change to 'AVRCP Play' will execute payload but next name change to 'AVRCP Play' should add letters or numbers after to be logged in log stream and execute payload as soon as name is changed$
# User can root in and run BloodyPods on remote machine or run at startup.
# Code may need to be altered to run on specific OS or file/folder system.
# Volume Mappings can be added to load specific channel triggers or add more features.
# Future Payloads, Payload pack ideas, and collaborations are welcome
# Run chmod +x bloodypods.sh before starting
# Ctrl + C to exit
