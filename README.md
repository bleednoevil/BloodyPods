## Summary
This code essentially allows a Bluetooth headphone to trigger payloads and audio at the same time. There is no loss of functionality, only a gain of features you could have never imagined.

## Hardware
BloodyPods Hardware: Apple AirPods Pro 2 (tested)/Any Bluetooth Receiver with Buttons & Apple macOS i5 & M1 Models (including High Sierra, Monterey and Sequoia) 

## Description & Background
This is pure code inspired by hackers & built for hackers. It allows automation for Red Teams and Blue Teams through gestures and button presses.

Use it for learning, expression, and pushing boundaries. I kept it as a Bash script to make it as simple as possible but I have a whole backend and architecture setup, with Python.

BloodyScript is coming soon!
Also, more documentation and reiterations are on the way. The code is not in any way perfect but it is operational and ready to be modified.

For the ones that look deeper you will find that this code will allow you to trigger payloads with your iOS device to a laptop 💻 or macOS device far away or nearby just by changing the name on the iOS device. Just drop Payload## with payload number instead of ##.

And if you look even deeper, you will find a worldwide communication system piggybacking off of Apple iCloud infrastructure without using iMessage.

Join me as we cultivate experiences for the future.  Suggestions for future payloads and payload packs are always welcome.  

I look forward to collaborating with so many of you.  The code was fully developed less than a month after DEF CON 33 Demo Labs where my research on AirBleed was presented and I connected with so many of you.  

Someone asked me where the code was going if not the property list on newer MacBooks and I didn’t know at the time but I figured it out. And I figured out how to repurpose that data.

Thank you to all for reaching out and connecting with me as well, this research and code is a part of those connections. I look forward to making new connections and learning more about cybersecurity.

I am available for public speaking on high level cybersecurity threats and bleeding-edge tool development. I am also available for consulting and roles in offensive cybersecurity as well.
